# YINI Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for [YINI](https://github.com/YINI-lang) configuration files.

- Works in VSCode and any editor supporting TextMate grammars.
- See `syntaxes/yini.tmLanguage.json` for the grammar.
- To test in VSCode, clone this repo and run `F5` to open an Extension Development Host.

## Usage

1. Open `.yini` files in VSCode.
2. If you use another editor (Sublime, Atom, etc), you can use `yini.tmLanguage.json` as your syntax file.

## Customization

- [Customizing Disabled Line Appearance in VSCode](./docs/VSCode.md)
